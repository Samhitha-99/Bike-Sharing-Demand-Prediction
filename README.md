<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.<hr>

<b>Algorithms for Model Training</b>

A model defines the relationship between features and label.A feature is an input variable—the x variable in simple linear regression.A label is the thing we're predicting—the y variable in simple linear regression.Training means creating or learning the model.In order to build the predictive model, it's time to implement some of the model training on the above selected feature.
